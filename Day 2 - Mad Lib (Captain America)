madlib = f"Attention all {famous_company} agents, this is {famous_person1}. \
You've heard a lot about me over the last few days. \
Some of you were even ordered to {verb1} me down. \
But I think it's time to know the truth. {famous_company} is not what we thought it was. \
It's been taken over by {famous_company1}. {famous_person2} is their leader. \
The {famous_company3} and {famous_company4} crew are {famous_company1} as well.\
I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building.\
They could be standing right next to you. \
They almost have what they want: {noun1}. \
They shot {famous_person3}, and it won't end there. \
If you launch the {vehicle1} today {famous_company1} will be able to {verb2} anyone that stands in their way... unless we {verb3} them. \
And I know I'm asking a lot. The price of freedom is high, it always has been.\
And it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. \
But I'm willing to bet I'm not."
